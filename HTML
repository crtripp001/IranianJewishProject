				<p class="bg-danger"><b>Who is behind this project?</b></p>
				<br>
					<p>We are a group of graduate and undergraduate students at UCLA who are passionate about the intersections of humanities and digital scholarship and who are interested in discovering how digital mapping can represent history in a geotemporal space that can enhance our understanding. In creating this project, each of us have brought our strengths and skills to come together in helping to map Iranian Jewish organizations in LA.</p>
					<br>

					<br>
				<p class="bg-danger"><b>What is this project about?</b></p>
				<br>
					<p>Easily recognized as one of the most ethnically diverse regions in the nation, Los Angeles is also home to one of the largest Jewish communities in the nation and it is estimated that roughly 30,000 Iranian Jews resettled in Los Angeles as result of the revolution, mostly in Beverly Hills, Santa Monica, Westwood, West Los Angeles, and Pico-Robertson.</p>
					<p>With a background in higher education, access to overseas funds, and experience in business, the Iranian Jewish community in LA quickly came together to form organizations that met their needs as a community and began to influence the broader Los Angeles Jewish community. This project hopes to explore how Iranian Jewish organizations in Los Angeles have shaped the broader Los Angeles Jewish community and Los Angeles as a whole.</p>

					<br>
				<p class="bg-danger"><b>What time periods are covered in this project?</b></p>
				<br>
					<p>For our initial launch of "Mapping Iranian Jewish Organizations in Los Angeles", we have chosen to focus on historical events and organizations formed from 1890 to the present in order to give visitors an overall glimpse of Iranian Jewish life in Los Angeles through the past century.</p>
					<br>
				<p class="bg-danger"><b>Why does this project only focus on Los Angeles?</b></p>
					<br>
					<p>We know that there are many other thriving communities of Iranian Jews, but as our team is based in Los Angeles, we wanted to start with the areas we knew best, close to home.</p>
					<br>
				<p class="bg-danger"><b>What is the purpose of this project? Who is it for?</b></p>
				<br>
					<p>This project hopes to become a resource for students, researchers, and community members looking for information, descriptions, and links to Iranian Jewish organizations in Los Angeles in a way that also historically contextualizes these organizations within space and time.</p>
